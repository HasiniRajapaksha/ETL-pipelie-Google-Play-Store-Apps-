# ETL Data Pipeline with Python

Welcome to the **ETL Data Pipeline** project! This repository demonstrates the basics of building an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline using Python, pandas, and SQLite. The "Google Play Store Apps" dataset is used as an example to showcase real-world data manipulation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Extract**: Load data from flat-files (.csv) into pandas DataFrames.
- **Transform**: Clean, filter, and analyze data for meaningful insights.
- **Load**: Save the transformed data into a SQLite database.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **pandas**: For data manipulation
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database
